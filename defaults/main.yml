# These are the exported nfs shares
# By default we'll only create directories on existing filesystem and export those
# But we can also create a LV from a VG, then mount and export it
# See export-2 example with lv_init, vg_name, lv_name and lv_size
# We'll also default to ext4 if lv_fstype isn't specified, see export-3
